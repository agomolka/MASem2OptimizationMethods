# MASem2OptimizationMethods
Project with non-classical Optimization Methods

Data science and machine learning are vital in today's world of rapidly increasing data. Hyperparameter tuning, crucial for precise model calibration, can be approached through techniques like Grid Search and Bayesian Optimization. This analysis examines their effectiveness, efficiency, and properties in machine learning. Findings can benefit practitioners, advance understanding, and inspire new strategies in this field.
